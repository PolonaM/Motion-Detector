In case of using pylint we get may errors like:
E1101: Module 'cv2' has no 'imshow' member (no-member)

To avoid that generate a pylint config file in the root of your project with this command: 
pylint --generate-rcfile > .pylintrc 
(To generate in the home directory: pylint --generate-rcfile > ~/.pylintrc)

At the beginning of the generated .pylintrc file you will see:
# A comma-separated list of package or module names from where C extensions may
# be loaded. Extensions are loading into the active Python interpreter and may
# run arbitrary code.
extension-pkg-whitelist=

Add cv2 so you end up with:
# A comma-separated list of package or module names from where C extensions may
# be loaded. Extensions are loading into the active Python interpreter and may
# run arbitrary code.
extension-pkg-whitelist=cv2

Save the file. The lint errors should disappear.
